<li>Stay home when you are sick.
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
<li>Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and throw the tissue away after use. If a tissue isnâ€™t available, cough or sneeze into your elbow or sleeve, not your hands.</li>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
<li>Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.</li>

           <ul><li> CDC does not recommend that people who are healthy wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.</li>
<li>Facemasks should be used by people who are ill to help prevent the spread of the disease to others.</li>
<li>The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).</li>
